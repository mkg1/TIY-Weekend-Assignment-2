## Employee Reviews - TIY Weekend Assignment 2

### Description
This code allows the user to initialize a department and add employees (with contact information and salary) to the department.  Once an employee has been added, he/she can be given a performance review and a performance score will be assigned based on the amount of positive vs negative points contained in the review. Employees can then be given raises, based on their performance.

### Objectives
The goal of this assignment was to implement test driven development in creating the program. Usage of blocks and yield, as well as regular expressions, were also part of the program objectives.
